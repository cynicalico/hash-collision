### I'm learning Japanese!

This isn't the first time, however. I have made many attempts at learning the language over the years, and I always burn out--usually after ~1-2 months. 

I don't really know why this is. My best guess is that it's something to do with the sheer magnitude of the task. Learning any language is quite difficult--some much more than others. Japanese is one of the oh-that's-really-hard-actually ones.

My plan this time isn't that different from previous attempts, aside from an extra resource. I've often started WaniKani, then given up around level 5-10 because it's just not very fun on its own. This time, I'm adding MaruMori, which is focused on grammar and vocabulary as opposed to kanji. It *also* teaches kanji, which is technically redundant, but good resources just generally do that.

### Why will it work this time?

I'm not sure if it will! I'm hoping doing weekly updates will help keep me accountable, even if I'm the only one who sees them. I'll be posting them on Sunday evenings as a sort of wrap up for the whole week. The first one will be this coming Sunday, which is only a few days away. I started again last Monday.

### JP-only

Once I'm at a level where I'm comfortable, I'd like to try and create some JP-only posts. These will be under their own category to keep them isolated from the normal English content.
