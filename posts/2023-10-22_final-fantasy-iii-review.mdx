I am going to start a series of video game reviews, I'm hoping it will help motivate me to actually finish games rather than abandoning them--which I do quite frequently.

There is something very intriguing to me about being able to say I've played every mainline Final Fantasy title. My first FF game was FFXIV, which is a wonderful game that I can't recommend to anyone because it has several hundred hours of story content + it's a subscription. Despite this I love it to bits, and I am looking forward to the expansion next May.

It's not exactly a *normal* Final Fantasy title, though. It's an MMO, and that means it plays like one. There is certainly plenty of FF DNA running through it, especially with regard to the story, but the actual gameplay is drastically different from previous titles. The combat is very similar to WoW's tab targeting system, whereas the old Final Fantasy titles were turn-based, and eventually used the well-regarded ATB system (and variants thereof).

### Interlude: Final Fantasy I & II

I played both games in Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls about a year back. I didn't really have that many opinions on them, I mostly played them for historical reasons, but I think those handful of notes will help contextualize my feelings on III:

1. Both games required a level of grind that I found unpleasant but tolerable--my understanding is this is largely because I played the Dawn of Souls version of these games, and it would have been *much* worse had I emulated the originals. I'm okay with this, as I do not consider pure grinding to be a valid game mechanic, and have DNFed games that I felt did it too heavily.

2. FFIIs individual stat level up system was interesting conceptually, but absolutely did not feel good, especially leveling HP. I felt accomplished having completed it, but I fully understand why it is considered the black sheep of the early games.

3. The game's stories today suffer from what I will call "curse of the originator". The trope of "group of unlikely heroes collect the 4 crystals of the elements to save the world from annihilation" *wasn't* a trope at the time they were written! The originator *is* Final Fantasy, that's where the generic JRPG story comes from! Despite this, going through both games leaves a *very* strong feeling of cheesiness that is hard to shake off.

4. I didn't have a great idea of where I was supposed to be going at any point--I believe this was worse in I than II but I'm not sure. This is a known attribute of all the early games.

### Story

Going into the game, I was already familiar with the Crystal Tower saga from FFXIV. Like most things in FFXIV, the names, locations, enemies, etc. are largely taken from a previous FF title. In this case, the title is FFIII!

Given my general familiarity, I was interested in seeing the originator--even if my memory of the raid series from FFXIV is pretty hazy, so I won't be doing any real comparisons here.

FFIII does not deviate from the formula of the previous games. You are still collecting the 4 crystals of the elements, there are just different things standing in your way. I found the beginning of the game to be a bit of a slog, especially with no airship, which I'd gotten used to from the previous titles.

I found the moment where Desch "dies" to have a bit of emotional weight. You don't travel with him for long, so it's not that tragic, but I appreciated the moment, as he was--at least up until right before it happened--just like you and your party, a very normal dude.

The entire story surrounding Doga, Unei, Xande, and the Cloud of Darkness is fairly competent, if not very deep. As I stated before, this game did not deviate from the simplistic level of storytelling from the previous titles, it just became more competent at it. It is still fundamentally the same plot of the forces of light and dark being unbalanced, and you, the Warriors of Light, must save it before the world falls to ruin. The specific set dressing of this instance of it is pretty to look at but in my opinion didn't add much else.

I did like the story moment where the key characters from earlier in the game all come together to help you escape the curse of the five wyrms in Syrcus Tower, that was cute.

### Gameplay

I have substantially more opinions here than the story. Additionally, I played the Pixel Remaster version of the game, so there were many QoL features present that I would not have otherwise had if I played the original.

#### Quick note on grinding

The auto battle was absolutely critical for grinding, and I continued using it all the way up until the final boss of the game. At one point in particular, at around level 30 and after gaining access to The Invincible, I went to Bahamut's lair and grinded the first room for ~1-2 hours until everyone reached level 50. Was this necessary? No. Did it actually kind of make the rest of the game too easy? Maybe! I was watching a TV show while doing this, and frankly it made the level grinding experience a lot more pleasant since it required very little interaction from me. Given my general thoughts on grinding are above, that is the only remark I will make on it.

#### Jobs

FFIII was the first title to implement the job system found in later titles. I really want to say that I think it was done well, as I've read so many others say before, but frankly I did not like it at all. This is what made me want to write a review, so much went wrong here.

Several fights effectively require a job or set of jobs to complete. The most notable is probably the Garuda fight, which I assume is technically completable otherwise but the game *very strongly* tells you to use dragoons. I only switched two party members to dragoon, and the jump attack did such massive damage it was over after only a few turns. For the rest of the game, dragoons are not special at all, and you never require them again.

I don't think this is very good game design! Jobs are leveled separately from character level, and jobs that aren't leveled at all will have very noticeable damage output reduction compared to leveled ones. This isn't to say you can't simply temporarily swap to a different one--I did not level dragoon whatsoever--but it means you are effectively discouraged from switching off the jobs you get early on in the game because their levels will be so much higher than new ones will get without doing a *lot* of extra grinding.

There's just no incentive outside the game forcing you to change jobs like this (in most cases, see below). I had to swap my black belt for a thief in a few spots because of locked doors, and then would swap right back afterward because of the damage output difference. I certainly was not going to grind thief levels just for that.

My final party consisted of a knight, ninja, and two sages--one with all black magic, and one with all white magic. Only the knight had a reasonable job level, the others only leveled from the dungeon crawl up to the final boss. Since ninja and sage are both very high level jobs, they still ended up being better options--shuriken do *insane* damage and sages can actually cast 8th level spells.

I can buy that monk → black belt → ninja isn't *necessarily* a direct progression, but the same can't really be said about the mage classes. Black mage → magus → sage, as well as white mage → devout → sage are pretty direct, and yet the experience from the previous jobs doesn't carry over at all! The progression is 100% reset every time.

I could accept a compromise, maybe even something like requiring the "previous" job to be level 99 first--which is not actually reasonable but it would give an *option* to progress as opposed to the current system.

#### Little things

Here's a list of small things where I only have a comment or two on them and having their own section would be a lot:

1. The Invincible is very good, having a mobile inn room eliminates a lot of the running back and forth between dungeons and town while grinding.

2. Hidden items are bad, imo. None of them are the most powerful items in the game or anything, but they're too easy to miss since they're, well, hidden.

3. I've expressed my distaste with forcing certain party comps already, but the mini sections where you also have to hope you're near a place to refresh your MP, since switching to a job does not give you full spell slots, adds insult to injury.

### Overall Rating

A solid **5/10**. I do not regret playing it, with the auto battle speedup it only took ~15 hours to complete from beginning to end based on Steam playtime, but I wouldn't recommend it outside of playing it for historical reasons.
